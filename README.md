# Modern House Wishlist
This is a list of features, architectural guidelines, construction techniques, and materials that a proper modern house should use, in varying states of organization.

- All construction should be using **screws**, not nails, to avoid squeaky or loose floors, walls, or other attachments.
- The front door should be a double-door _without_ a center post, to allow easily moving things into and out of the house.
  - Care should be taken when constructing hallways that further constrict movement past the width of the double-doors
- Absolutely no room with a toilet or sink should *ever* have a carpet.
  - Carpet should be avoided in general, but is acceptable in hallways or bedrooms.
- All windows should be double-pane laminated glass without any "vents" that would compromise noise-abatement.
- All caulking must be done BEFORE painting.
- All interior areas of the house, minus the garage, should have at least a crawlspace underneath.
  - The crawlspace must have suitable ventilation, with properly sealed vents and dryer vent exits protected with metal grating. Everything in the crawlspace should be insulated properly and be reasonably accessible.
- The HVAC system must be some kind of forced air, involving at least one reversible heat pump. Multiple split systems that divide the house into multiple zones is ideal but not required.
  - All zones should have access to energy recovery ventilation of some kind.
  - Every room with one or more outflow vents must also have intake vents sufficient to equalize pressure.
  - If the house does not have very many zones, all vents should be smart vents.
- Insulation should be placed in all the walls, including interior ones.
- Drywall should be the 8x dense soundproof material.
- All doors should be solid core wood and aligned properly.
  - Doors should either be low enough to have a threshold or have a rubber sweep to minimize noise
- All rooms should have sufficient lights in the ceiling to illuminate the entire room evenly, attached to a light switch
- All windows should have screens
- All bedroom windows should have rolling shutters that actually block all light.
